# I'm not a developer, but that never stopped me from trying to learn.

### Every time I open up a new project, I pick up some new paradigm I had never touched. Then stuff breaks. And with breaking stuff, and then fixing it, I learn why it reacted the way it did. the "Learning by head-banging" method has not stopped being fun since I started.

### So I created this space to share those experiences: how I broke stuff, how I fixed it, and what I learnt from the process. 

### Ready? come along for the ride!
